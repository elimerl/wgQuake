1. About

QuakeSpasm is a modern cross-platform Quake engine based on FitzQuake.

It includes support for 64 bit CPUs and custom music playback, a new
sound driver, some graphical niceities, and numerous bug-fixes and
other improvements.

Quakespasm utilizes SDL-1.2 or SDL2 frameworks, choose one which works
best for you. SDL2 has nicer features, smoother mouse input and better
support for newer operating systems, but no CD-ROM support.

2. Downloads

-   Project Downloads: http://quakespasm.sourceforge.net/download.htm

-   Latest code repository:
    https://sourceforge.net/p/quakespasm/quakespasm/ci/master/tree/

-   Github mirror:
    https://github.com/sezero/quakespasm

3. Hints

Visit the FitzQuake homepage <https://celephais.net/fitzquake/> for a
full run-down of the engine's commands and variables.

-   To disable some changes, use "quakespasm -fitz"

-   Quakespasm's custom data is stored in "quakespasm.pak". Install
    this file alongside your id1 directory to enable the custom console
    background and other minor features.

-   For different sound backend drivers use :
    "SDL_AUDIODRIVER=DRIVER ./quakespasm"
    where DRIVER may be alsa, dsp, pulse, esd ...

-   Shift+Escape draws the Console.

-   From the console, use UP to browse the command line history and TAB
    to autocomplete command and map names.

-   There is currently no CD Music volume support and SDL2 doesn't
    support CD audio. cd_sdl.c needs replacing with cd_linux.c,
    cd_bsd.c etc..

-   In windows, alternative CD drives are accessible by
    "quakespasm -cddev F" (for example)

-   Quakespasm allows loading new games (mods) on the fly with
    "game GAMENAME {-quoth/hipnotic/rogue}"

-   Use "quakespasm -condebug" to save console log to "qconsole.log".
    SDL2 builds no longer generate stdout.txt/stderr.txt.

Music Playback:

Quakespasm can play various external music formats, including MP3, OGG
and FLAC.

-   Tracks should be named like "track02.ogg", "track03.ogg" ... (there
    is no track01) and placed into "Quake/id1/music".

-   Unix users may need some extra libraries installed: "libmad" or
    "libmpg123" for MP3, and "libogg" and "libvorbis" for OGG.

-   Use the "-noextmusic" option to disable this feature.

-   As of 0.90.0, music is played back at 44100 Hz by default with no
    need to adjust "-sndspeed".

-   See Quakespasm-Music.txt for more details.

Controller Support:

The SDL2 variant of Quakespasm supports Xbox 360 style game
controllers.

The default configuration uses the left analog stick for movement and
the right for looking.

If your controller doesn't work you can try placing this file
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB/master/gamecontrollerdb.txt
in your Quake directory, it is a community-maintained database that
adds support for more controllers to SDL2.

Controller Support - Cvars:

-   joy_deadzone_look - Fraction of look stick travel to be deadzone,
    between 0 and 1. Default is 0.175.

-   joy_deadzone_move - Same as above, but for the move stick. Default
    is 0.175.

-   joy_deadzone_trigger - Fraction of trigger range required to
    register a button press on the analog triggers, between 0 and 1.
    Default 0.2.

-   joy_outer_threshold_look - Outer deadzone for the look stick,
    between 0 and 1. Default 0.02.

-   joy_outer_threshold_move - Outer deadzone for the move stick,
    between 0 and 1. Default 0.02.

-   joy_sensitivity_yaw/pitch - Max angular speed in degrees/second
    when looking. Defaults are 240 for yaw (turning left/right) and 130
    for pitch (up/down).

-   joy_exponent - For the look stick, the stick displacement (between
    0 and 1) is raised to this power. Default is 2. A value of 1 would
    give a linear relationship between stick displacement and fraction
    of the maximum angular speed.

-   joy_exponent_move - Same as joy_exponent but for the move stick.
    Default is 2.

-   joy_invert - Set to 1 to invert the vertical axis of the look
    stick.

-   joy_swapmovelook - Set to 1 to swap the left and right analog stick
    functions. Default is 0, move on the left stick, look on the right
    stick.

-   joy_enable - Set to 0 to disable controller support. Default is 1.

Controller Support - Buttons:

Some of the controller buttons are hardcoded to allow navigating the
menu:

-   Back - alias for TAB
-   Start - alias for ESC
-   DPad, analog sticks - mapped to arrow keys
-   A Button - alias for ENTER in menus
-   B Button - alias for ESC in menus

These buttons can be bound normally:

-   LTRIGGER - Left trigger
-   RTRIGGER - Right trigger
-   LSHOULDER - Left shoulder button
-   RSHOULDER - Right shoulder button
-   LTHUMB - Clicking the left thumbstick
-   RTHUMB - Clicking the right thumbstick
-   ABUTTON
-   BBUTTON
-   XBUTTON
-   YBUTTON

quakespasm.pak contains a default.cfg which has been updated to give
some default bindings. L/R shoulder buttons are bound to weapon
switching, and L/R triggers are jump and attack.

The controller support started as Jeremiah Sypult's implementation in
Quakespasm-Rift, and also uses ideas/code from LordHavoc's DarkPlaces.

4. Compiling and Installation

See the Downloads section to get the sourcecode, then below for
platform specific instructions. Quakespasm can also be built with the
cross-platform Codeblocks.
Quakespasm's (optional) custom data is now stored in the file
quakespasm.pak. This file should be placed alongside your quakespasm
binary and id1 directory.

Compiling for Linux/Unix:

After extracting the source tarball, "cd Quake" and edit the Makefile
for music options.

Streaming music playback requires "libmad" or "libmpg123" for MP3, and
"libogg" and "libvorbis" for OGG files.

Then type "make" to compile the program, and copy the "quakespasm"
binary (and "quakespasm.pak") to your Quake game directory.
Compile time options include

-   make DO_USERDIRS=1 to include user directories support

-   make DEBUG=1 for debugging

-   make SDL_CONFIG=/PATH/TO/sdl-config for unusual SDL installations

-   make USE_SDL2=1 to compile against SDL2 instead of SDL-1.2

Compiling for Windows:

QuakeSpasm developers cross-compile windows binaries using MinGW-w64
<http://mingw-w64.sf.net> and MinGW <https://mingw.osdn.io>. The
project can also be built using Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 and newer
versions.

Compiling for Mac OS X:

A Quakespasm App (including program launcher and update framework) can
be made using the Xcode template found in the MacOSX directory.

Alternatively, have a look at Makefile.darwin for more instructions on
building from a console.

Quake '2021 re-release':

QuakeSpasm 0.94 has support for playing the 2021 re-release content:
Copy the quakespasm binary to your rerelease installation and run as
you normally do.

-   Invalid skin index now draws skin 0 (WinQuake behaviour) instead of
    blue checkerboard.

-   Change default screenshot format to png. The 'screenshot' command
    now supports optional format (tga, png or jpg) and quality (1-100)
    arguments.

-   Revert "always run" changes from 0.85.9 and move the QuakeSpasm
    customizations to a new "cl_alwaysrun" cvar: Set to 1 in order to
    scale forward/side/up speed by "cl_movespeedkey" (usually 2), and
    to make "speedkey" act as "slowkey".

-   Change the "always run" menu option to offer three choices:
    off (cl_alwaysrun 0, cl_forwardspeed 200, cl_backspeed 200)
    vanilla (cl_alwaysrun 0, cl_forwardspeed 400, cl_backspeed 400)
    quakespasm (cl_alwaysrun 1, cl_forwardspeed 200, cl_backspeed 200)

-   New "gl_cshiftpercent_contents", "gl_cshiftpercent_damage",
    "gl_cshiftpercent_bonus", "gl_cshiftpercent_powerup" cvars for
    tuning the strength of specic view blends.

-   GL2 renderer: use a GLSL shader for world faces. Fixes reports of
    integrated+discrete GPU laptops having inconsistent fog rendering.

-   Fix macOS startup delay (avoid calling gethostbyname() for ".local"
    hostnames).

-   Fix memory corruption in PF_lightstyle with out of bounds
    lightstyles.

-   Updated some of the third-party libraries.

Changes in 0.92.0:

-   SDL2 Game Controller support.

-   Contrast support with new "contrast" cvar, behaving the same as
    MarkV. It may be a useful alternative to the existing gamma control
    for laptops in a bright environment, etc. Raising contrast gives
    less of a gray/washed out look than raising gamma, but at a
    disadvantage: colors near white get clipped to white.

-   RMQ protocol (999) support, adapted from RMQEngine.

-   New "-protocol x" command line option. Accepted values for 'x' are
    15 (NetQuake), 666 (FitzQuake, default), and 999 (RMQ).

-   New "setpos" console command.

-   New "vid_borderless" cvar for getting a borderless window.

    256 to 512 in order to handle the oms3 map pack.

-   Server edicts are now allocated using malloc instead of allocating
    on the hunk.

-   gl_clear now defaults to 1.

-   Fix items falling out of the world on oms3.bsp on SSE builds.

-   Worked around an OSX 10.6 driver bug when using FSAA, which was
    leading to an unplayable HOM effect on the rest of the screen.

-   Fix wrong trace endpoint from the tracepos console command.

-   Updated some of the third-party libraries. Other fixes/clean-ups.

Changes in 0.91.0:

Bugfixes:

-   Fix unwanted fog mode change upon video restart.

-   Work around Intel 855 bug in status bar drawing with "r_oldwater 0"
    and "scr_sbaralpha 0".

-   Fix an obscure GLSL bug where changing gamma would result in the
    screen turning to noise.

-   Fix GLSL gamma causing the tiled screen border to turn white when
    "sizedown" is used.

-   Fix an alias model VBO renderer bug where a model not precached
    during map start wouldn't be drawn.

    SDL2 video.

-   Fix a calling convention issue in windows DPI awareness function
    pointers.

-   Fix a random texture recoloring after video mode change.

    and "r_oldwater 0".

-   Fix a wrong alpha-sorting bug introduced in 0.90.1.

-   Fix "flush" command not reloading mdl's from disk (bug introduced
    in 0.90.1).

-   Prevent a possible buffer overflow in Cbuf_Execute (old Q1/Q2 bug).

-   Prevent a possible vulnerability in MSG_ReadString (old Q1/Q2 bug).

Visual improvements:

-   New cvars r_lavaalpha, r_slimealpha, r_telealpha for fine-tuning
    specific liquid opacities (from DirectQ/RMQEngine, non-archived,
    default to 0), and new worldspawn keys \_wateralpha, \_lavaalpha,
    \_slimealpha, \_telealpha, \_skyfog (unique to Quakespasm, similar to
    the behaviour of the "fog" worldspawn key).

-   GLSL gamma is now supported on older hardware without NPOT
    extension.

Interface improvements:

-   New r_pos command to show player position.

-   NaN detection in traceline with "developer 1" set now warns instead
    of errors.

Code cleanup / Other:

-   Update third-party libraries.

Raised limits:

-   Default max_edicts 8192 (was 2048) and no longer saved to
    config.cfg.

-   Default heapsize 256 MB (was 64 MB).

-   Default zone 4 MB (was 384 KB).

-   Raised MAX_SFX to 1024 (was 512).

Changes in 0.90.1:

    https://forums.insideqc.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=5620)

-   Fix fullbrights turning black after "kill" command (bug introduced
    in 0.90.0).

    with retrojam1_skacky.bsp.

-   Fix viewmodel not lerping on extended-limit maps.

-   Fix crash on out-of-bounds skin number.

Performance:

-   Use multithreaded OpenGL on OS X for better performance.

-   New, faster mdl renderer using GLSL. Disable with "-noglslalias".

Visual improvements:

-   New gamma correction implementation using GLSL. Fixes all known
    gamma issues (affecting the full display, persisting after
    quitting, or darkening the screen on OS X). Disable with
    "-noglslgamma".

-   Use high-quality water by default (r_oldwater 0).

-   Shadows use stencil buffer to avoid overlapping artifacts (from
    MarkV.)

-   r_noshadow_list cvar added (from MarkV.)

Interface improvements:

-   Support pausing demo playback with the "pause" command.

-   Autocompletion for "game", "record", "playdemo".

-   Experimental windowed fullscreen mode available with
    vid_desktopfullscreen 1 (only in SDL2 builds, takes effect upon
    entering fullscreen mode the next time.)

-   Silence "exceeded standard limit" messages unless developer cvar is

    > = 1.

-   Some spam moved from developer 1 to 2: "can't find tga/lit/ent",
    "trying to load ent", "bad chunk length", "meshing",
    "PR_AlocStringSlots: realloc'ing"

Code cleanup:

-   Clean up IDE project files to build on fresh systems.

-   Update 3rd-party libraries.

Changes in 0.90.0:

-   Fix issues on Windows systems with DPI scaling.

-   Unix/Mac user directories support. Disabled by default,
    'make DO_USERDIRS=1' to enable it.

-   SDL2 support. Disabled by default, 'make USE_SDL2=1' to enable it.

-   Revised keyboard input code.

-   Revised/improved the 'game' command, i.e. on-the-fly mod changing.
    It now accepts an optional second argument for mission packs or
    quoth support i.e. -hipnotic, -rogue, or -quoth. For example, for
    WarpSpasm: "game warp -quoth"

-   Command line: "-game {quoth/hipnotic/rogue}" is now treated the
    same as -quoth, -hipnotic, or -rogue.

-   Console speed now resolution-independent.

-   Disabled gl_zfix, which caused glitches and is undesirable for new
    maps. Replacement .ent files to fix z-fighting for several id1 maps
    added to quakespasm.pak.

-   PF_VarString buffer bumped to 1024, avoids truncated centerprints
    from the 'In The Shadows' mod.

-   Support for opengl non-power-of-two-textures extension (disable
    with command line: "-notexturenpot".)

-   Support for OpenGL vertex buffer objects (VBO, OpenGL 1.5 or newer)
    for world and brush models (disable with command line: "-novbo".)

-   Antialiasing (FSAA) support (command line: -fsaa x, where x can be
    0, 2, 4, 8).

-   Fence textures support.

-   Dynamic light speedup. Speedup loading of tga and pcx external
    images.

-   Brush model drawing speedup.

-   Support for BSP2 and 2PSB map formats.

-   Support for Opus, FLAC, and tracker music (S3M, IT, UMX, etc.), as
    compile-time options.

-   Music and sfx now mixed at 44100 Hz to avoid downsampling music.
    Low-pass filter applied to the sfx if -sndspeed is 11025 (the
    default), to preserve the same sound quality as 0.85.9. New
    -mixspeed option sets the rate for mixing sfx and music, and output
    to the OS (default 44100), setting it to 11025 reverts to 0.85.9
    behaviour. New snd_filterquality cvar, value can be between 1
    (emulate OS X resampler) and 5 (emulate Windows resampler),
    controls the sound of the low-pass filter.

-   Better Hor+ field of view (FOV) scaling behavior.

-   Better cross-map demo playback support.

-   Fix screenshots when screen width isn't a multiple of 4.

-   Fix a looping sounds glitch.

-   Fix a vulnerability in file extension handling. Tighten path
    handling safety.

-   Initialize opengl with 24-bit depth buffer at 32 bpp.

-   Reset all models upon gamedir changes. (Fixes failures with mods
    using custom content.)

-   Fix broken behavior upon gamedir changes if -basedir is specified
    on the command line.

-   NET_MAXMESSAGE and MAX_MSGLEN limits bumped to 64000.

-   MAX_EFRAGS bumped to 4096, and MAX_CHANNELS to 1024.

-   MAX_ENT_LEAFS bumped from 16 to 32 to work around disappearing or
    flickering brush models in some situations. Also, if an entity is
    visible from MAX_ENT_LEAFS or more leafs, we now always send it to
    the client.

-   Fix cvar cycle command not working sometimes.

-   Host_Error upon missing models. (Prevents segmentation faults.)

-   Change sv_aim default value to 1 (i.e. turn off autoaim)

-   Add 'prev' and 'next' keywords to the 'cd' command.

-   Work around a linux cdrom issue (playback might not start for a
    while after a stop).

-   Quakespasm content customization moved from engine-embedded into a
    new optional quakespasm.pak file.

-   Version bumped to 0.90.0 (because Quakespasm has a decent life of
    it's own)

-   Other fixes and clean-ups.

Changes in 0.85.9:

-   Fixes for several undefined behaviors in C code (gcc-4.8 support.)

-   Implemented Hor+ style field of view (FOV) scaling, useful for

    crashes with excessively long global strings seen in some rude
    mods.

-   Toned down warning messages from PF_VarString() a bit.

-   Fixed Fitzquake's map existence check in changelevel (used to leak
    file handles which would end up in a Sys_Error() due to consuming
    all free handles if many maps reside not in pak files.)

-   Fixes/cleanups in chat mode handling. Client no longer gets stuck
    in chat mode upon disconnect.

-   Mouse grab/key_dest fixes and key cleanups.

-   The "speedkey" now acts as "slowkey" when "always run" is on.
